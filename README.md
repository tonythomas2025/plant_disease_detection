# EfficientNet-B0 Plant Disease Classification

This project implements a deep learning pipeline using PyTorch and EfficientNet-B0 for classifying plant diseases from the PlantVillage dataset. It includes automatic dataset splitting, data augmentation, balanced sampling, model training with early stopping, and final evaluation.

## Project Overview

The project uses the EfficientNet-B0 architecture pretrained on ImageNet to classify 15 classes of plant diseases. It handles class imbalance with a weighted random sampler and employs various data augmentation techniques to improve generalization. Early stopping based on validation accuracy is implemented to avoid overfitting.

## Dataset

- Source:(https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/emmarex/plantdisease)  
- The dataset is automatically split into training (70%), validation (15%), and test (15%) sets by the script.

---

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/efficientnet-plant-disease.git
   cd efficientnet-plant-disease
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install torch torchvision tqdm
   ```

---

## Usage

Place your PlantVillage dataset in the folder specified by `SOURCE_DIR` in the script. Then run the main script:

```bash
python train_efficientnet.py
```

The script will:
- Automatically split the dataset if not already split.
- Train the model with data augmentation and balanced sampling.
- Save the best model based on validation accuracy.
- Evaluate the final model on the test set.

## Training and Evaluation

- Uses data augmentation including random crops, flips, rotations, color jitter, and random erasing during training.
- WeightedRandomSampler is used to address class imbalance.
- CrossEntropyLoss and Adam optimizer.
- Early stopping based on validation accuracy to prevent overfitting.
- After training, the best model is loaded for final evaluation on the test set.

---

## Results

- **Classes Detected:** 15  
- **Training Accuracy:** ~98.95%  
- **Validation Accuracy:** ~99.64% (best)  
- **Final Test Accuracy:** ~68%  

> Note: The test accuracy reflects the final evaluation metric for model performance on unseen data.
